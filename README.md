# Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker 

## Introduction  

This assignment was given for any user of the program to keep track of employees within a company. The program allows the user to view, add, and remove employees, departments and roles. Also allows to update an existing employee's role. This program uses inquirer to prompt the user on what functions he would like to execute. It uses mySQL database as the database store. It also uses a node package called console table that prints out the information in a neat way in the terminal.

## Objective 

```md
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
```

## Process  

* I started with copying the basic boilerplates that I could utilize.
* I started writing the server.js file from creating a schema I made on paper.
* Once I finished the server.js file, I started creating the sql files and made adjustments to my js file as needed.
* I got connected via node and tested it out and realized I had to join things to get everything to generate inside the console.  
   
## My_Challenges  

I struggled and remade this assignment more than I can count. Understanding the logic behind the communication from your application to SQL workbench database took a moment to figure out with having the right things intalled inside your JSON file. I utilized a classmate on the large javascript code and how to break it down for rthis assignment.
